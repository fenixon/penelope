function renderHtmlEmail($body) {
    ob_start();
    include ('my_html_email.php');
    return ob_get_clean();
}
In your my_html_email.php file you would have something like so:

<html>
    <body>
        <p>....<p>
        <!-- the body -->
        <?php echo $body; ?>
    </body>
</html>
And

 $mailer->Body = renderHtmlEmail($contact_message);
